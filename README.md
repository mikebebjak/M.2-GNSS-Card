There are plenty of USB GNSS modules but very few M.2 modules for PCs. This project sought to rectify this issue by using a u-Blox M8C chip on a M.2 card. This way you can add GNSS to any PC when customers do not want to use external USB dongles. 
This card uses an HF4 antenna header for an external antenna (either direct or through a converter cable).
You can also download u-Blox software to test it out in Windows, as the attached screenshot shows.
Hopefully this helps someone!
